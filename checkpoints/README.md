## Checkpoints
### overview
Model checkpoints used in the paper can be downloaded from [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u5RsCuZNf7ddWW0utI4OrgWGmJCUDCuT?usp=sharing).

Model training should be very easy with the provided training scripts. 

### checkpoints for bagnet/resnet trained on imagenette
two re-trained models are available now, more to come!
